# Bootstrap5Demo

This Angular + Bootstrap project demonstrates Bootstrap component interaction without the aid of jQuery - and with the assistance of the @types/bootstrap library in TypeScript.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
